AngleSharp.Io
=============

AngleSharp.Io extends AngleSharp with powerful requesters, caching mechanisms, and storage systems. It is coupled more strongly to the underlying operating system than AngleSharp itself. Therefore it has stronger dependencies and demands and cannot be released as a PCL.
